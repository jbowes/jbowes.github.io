      <description>&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday evening, whilst I was playing &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/15363&#34;&gt;Nexus
Ops&lt;/a&gt; with a few mates, the toilet
began to gurgle (it turns out it had been gurgling all day). After a usage and
a flush, the toilet overflowed with such speed that more than half of our
apartment was flooded before the water could be stopped. It turns out there
had been some blockage in the sewer lines to the apartment building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cherie and I then spent the next two days soaking up water, moving furniture
and cats around, and generally having a bad time. The apartment complex paid
to have someone come in and clean the carpets, and next week they will be
replacing the linoleum in the bathroom. I ended up working from home on
Thursday and Friday to help Cherie as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only good thing to come out of this was that we had a great excuse to
order take out.&lt;/p&gt;
